🎉 Next.js Authentication Project 🚀
Welcome to the Next.js Authentication Project! This application provides user authentication using NextAuth, supporting both credential-based login/signup and third-party providers (Google, LinkedIn, GitHub). It integrates with a PostgreSQL database hosted on Vercel and uses Drizzle ORM for seamless database interactions.

📦 Features
🔐 Credential-based authentication: Users can sign up and log in using their email and password.
🌐 Third-party login: Supports authentication via Google, LinkedIn, and GitHub.
💾 Database Integration: Uses PostgreSQL for data storage.
⚙️ ORM: Drizzle ORM for handling database operations.
🛠️ Getting Started
Prerequisites
🧑‍💻 Node.js: Version 14 or higher.
🗄️ PostgreSQL Database: Set up and hosted on Vercel.
🚀 Vercel Account: For PostgreSQL hosting.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up environment variables:

Create a .env.local file in the root directory and add the following variables:

env
Copy code
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret
DATABASE_URL=your-postgresql-database-url
Replace your-nextauth-secret with a secure secret for NextAuth and your-postgresql-database-url with the URL of your PostgreSQL database on Vercel.

Run the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
Your application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

🔐 Middleware Configuration
Note: Middleware configuration is pending. For a secure application, you should configure NextAuth middleware to protect routes and manage authentication.
